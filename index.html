            <div id="WhatIsNovel1" class="BookContent1">
                <p id="Contents" style="text-align: left;">A Novel for the most part is just like
                    a Light Novel, the main sctick of a Novel though is that it is significantly
                    longer per volume and usually uses more complicated words.

                    <br><br>

                    it is not something that aims to be a quick and easy read while travelling
                    compared to Light Novels. Another thing about Novels is the lack of images or
                    illustrations that help readers visualize, it relies more on the readers imaginations.
                    It isn't all bad though as Novels have 1 thing Light novels do not do. They tell the
                    reader who says what at a given time.

            <div id="MushokuTenseiStory1" class="BookContent1"> 
                <p id="Contents" style="text-align: left;">Mushoku Tensei is one of my most favourite Light Novels as it was one of
                    my first Light Novels that I have read. It depicts a middle aged man who 
                    wasted his life exploiting his parents kindness until they died, to which 
                    he was kicked out by his siblings before dying and getting a second chance 
                    at life. The entire story is him from when he was born all the way till he 
                    dies from old age as he does his best living life to the fullest and leaving 
                    no regrets. <br><br>

                    It isn't the main reason why I like it but instead him encountering past life 
                    traumas and showing growth as he overcomes them in his new life, but it isn't 
                    all ups and instead also has downs as he himself was immature and it lead to 
                    the deaths of his loved ones, showing despair and strength as he carries his 
                    mistakes and improves on himself with the support of those around him.

            <div id="ReMonsterStory1" class="BookContent1">
                <p id="Contents" style="text-align: left;">Re:Monster while not liked as much as Mushoku Tensei,
                    it's still one of the best for me. It was also actually my first Light Novel even if it never
                    got me into Light Novels.

                    <br><br>

                    Now the reason why it didn't get me into Light Novels despite being one of my favourites, is
                    all due to the fact that it isn't written like a typical Light Novel, it is writted like a journal
                    log, from stuff like

                    <br><br>
                    [Day 1 - I was born]<br>
                    I don't know what happened but I woke up in a completely unknown world as a baby
                    <br><br>

                    to<br><br>

                    [Day 120 - I built a hot springs]<br>
                    Having more resources in hand, I have decided to make a hotsprings to renew my japanese spirit.
                    Because this place does not have the concept of baths.

                    Web novels have existed since the internet became widespread. It was a way that let
                    many authors aspiring or professionals to publish their work to a wider audience.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    One popular site for authors to post their work in japan would be "Shōsetsuka ni Narō"
                    and if their work was popular enough it can get picked up by a editor from a publishing
                    company, then if all went well the web novel would eventually become a novel to be sold
                    for the author's to earn cash.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="MoneyEarned1" class="BookContent1">
                <p id="Contents" style="text-align: left;">Money earned from being
                a light novel author can be as little as about $100 a month up to
                $500 a month. Which is not enough to live, it's not an easy job and also
                requires a bit of luck, so even if you are skilled enough to write breathtaking
                light novel stories, if it doesn't fit the trend, or it starts off slow and many
                others, it could lead to people dropping the series you are making and/or not travelling
                the people they know about it.
            
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, if your work gets noticed and gains traction into fame. Your salary 
                can go up to $45,000 after tax. And even more potentially if companies want to make products/
                shows/and more, netting you even more profits.
            
                <br><br>
                So while it may or may not be rewarding, if you do get noticed, it may be worth it especially
                if you enjoy writing stories.</p>

                <p id="Contents" style="text-align: left;">
                    To put things simply as a start, the key difference between a Light Novel and a Novel
                    would be their page lengths per volume as well as Light Novels having images between,
                    usually to illustrate the importance of the current situation that the reader is
                    currently reading.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    The example shown is the text you are currently reading as well as the image.

            <div id="WhatIsNovel2" class="BookContent2">
                <p id="Contents" style="text-align: left;">"To illustrate this difference" said the narrator,
                    "I'll emulate what novels do for this section" he followed up as he types this short paragraph.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Considering how long novels tend to get it is quite important that the readers don't get
                    confused about what is currently happening.

                    Lastly, it is thanks to the pov(point of view) where we see everyone's thoughts 
                    and impressions of him that lets us see misunderstandings that he may have head
                    that makes us hope he realizes the mistakes and goes towards fixing his relationships
                    after. At the end of the whole series it felt like I was a dad watching the growth of
                    a child becoming an independant adult that can think for himself and has people that
                    depend on him.

                    But you get the picture, even now I don't usually see a light novel written like a journal log
                    or a diary and it was a unique experience.
